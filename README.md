# Overview

This repository serves as a demonstration for the CardScan library. [CardScan](https://cardscan.io/) is a relatively small library (1.9 MB) that provides fast and accurate payment card scanning.

CardScan is the foundation for CardVerify enterprise libraries, which validate the authenticity of payment cards as they are scanned.

## Requirements

* Android API level 21 or higher
* AndroidX compatibility
* Kotlin coroutine compatibility

Note: Your app does not have to be written in kotlin to integrate this library, but must be able to depend on kotlin functionality.

## Demo

This repository contains a demonstration app for the CardScan product. To build and install this library follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository from github
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-demo-android
    ```
    
2. Build the library using gradle or [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
    a. Using android studio, open the directory `cardscan-demo-android`. Install the app on your device or an emulator by clicking the play button in the top right of android studio.
    
    ![build_android_studio](docs/images/build_android_studio.png)
    
    b. Using gradle, build the demo app by executing the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ./gradlew demo:assembleRelease
    ```
    This will create a release APK in the `cardscan-demo/build/outputs/apk` directory. Copy this file to your device and install it.

## Installation

The CardScan libraries are published in the [jcenter](https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/getbouncer/) repository, so for most gradle configurations you only need to add the dependencies to your app's `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.getbouncer:cardscan-ui:2.0.0010'
}
```

## Using

Most apps that integrate CardScan should do so with the [CardScan UI library](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ui-android). See the README file in that repository for details on integration.

To build a custom user interface on top of the scan framework, use the [scan-ui-card library](https://github.com/getbouncer/scan-ui-card-android). See the README file in that repository for details on integration.

## Provisioning an API key

Make sure that you get an [API key](https://api.getbouncer.com/console) and configure the library when your application launches. 

## Name extraction support (BETA)

To test name extraction, please first provision an API key, then reach out to support@bouncer.com with details about your use case and estimated volumes.

In the ```CardScanActivity.warmUp()``` function, be sure to set the `enableNameExtraction` variable to `true`:

```kotlin
CardScanActivity.warmUp(this, API_KEY, true);
```

## Customizing

CardScan is built to be customized to fit your UI.

### Basic modifications

To modify text, colors, or padding of the default UI, see the [customization](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ui-android/blob/master/docs/customize.md) documentation.

### Extensive modifications

To modify arrangement or UI functionality, CardScan can be used as a library for your custom implementation. See examples in the [scan-ui-card-android](https://github.com/getbouncer/scan-ui-card-android) repository.

## Developing

See the [development docs](docs/develop.md) for details on developing for CardScan.
